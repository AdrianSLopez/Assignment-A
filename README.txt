Run code: 
    My code works fine with main.py, as long as you run main.py then you are able to run my code.


Which algorithm performed the fastest?



Which took up the most memory?


Which gave the best solution?
    For data in ex2.txt and ex3.txt, my algorithms gave the same answer. Based on ex1.txt, I say Breadth-first search gave the best solution,
    because not only did it reach the goal state, but also all numbers were in the correct position.
